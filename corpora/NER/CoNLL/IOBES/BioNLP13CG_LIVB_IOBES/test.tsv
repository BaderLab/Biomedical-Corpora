In	O

,	O
Harold	O
Dvorak	O
and	O
his	O
colleagues	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
show	O
that	O

secreted	O

(	O

and	O
that	O
a	O

could	O
prevent	O
the	O
edema	O
and	O
fluid	O

that	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
human	S-LIVB
cancers	O
.	O

In	O
1986	O
,	O
Dvorak	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
secreted	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
human	S-LIVB
tumor	O
cell	O
lines	O
and	O
proposed	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
in	O
part	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
abnormal	O
vasculature	O
seen	O
in	O
human	S-LIVB
tumors	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
result	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
other	O
investigators	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
VPF	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
stimulating	O
endothelial	O
cell	O
growth	O
and	O
angiogenesis	O
.	O

These	O
fundamental	O
discoveries	O
led	O
to	O
additional	O
research	O
conducted	O
by	O
Napoleone	O
Ferrara	O
and	O
his	O
laboratory	O
,	O
confirming	O
the	O
cloning	O
of	O
VPF	O
and	O
renaming	O
the	O
protein	O
vascular	O
endothelial	O
growth	O
factor	O
(	O

)	O
.	O

In	O
1986	O
,	O
Dvorak	O
proposed	O
that	O
by	O
secreting	O
VPF	O
,	O
tumors	O
induce	O
angiogenesis	O
by	O
turning	O
on	O
the	O
wound	O

.	O

He	O
noted	O
that	O
wounds	O
,	O
like	O
tumors	O
,	O
secrete	O
VPF	O
,	O
causing	O
blood	O
vessels	O
to	O
leak	O
plasma	O
fibrinogen	O
,	O
which	O
stimulates	O
blood	O
vessel	O
growth	O
and	O
provides	O
a	O
matrix	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
can	O
spread	O
.	O

Unlike	O
wounds	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
turn	O
off	O
VPF	O
production	O
after	O
healing	O
,	O
tumors	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
off	O
their	O
VPF	O
production	O
and	O
instead	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
large	O
amounts	O
of	O
VPF	O
,	O
allowing	O
malignant	O
cells	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
induce	O
new	O
blood	O
vessels	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
grow	O
and	O

Thus	O
,	O
tumors	O
behave	O

wounds	O
that	O
